# Solr4J 

Solr4J is a work-in-progress project that aims to embed a full [Solr](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/) server inside a
java application. This is not a Solr API or management tool, only management of the Solr server installation and support
for starting and stopping the server, as well as defining core templates using config sets.

For a Java API to use the Solr REST API, use the [SolrJ API](https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/6_6/using-solrj.html).

This project is heavily inspired of the [MariaDB4J project](https://github.com/vorburger/MariaDB4j), which does a similar
thing as this project, but to launch a MariaDB database from Java.
